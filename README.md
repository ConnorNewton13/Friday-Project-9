This is a simple Python application that uses the OpenAI API to generate text completions based on a user's input. The app provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) built with `Tkinter`. Users can enter a prompt, submit it, and see the response generated by the OpenAI API.

- Enter a prompt in the input field.
- Submit the prompt and receive a text completion.
- Display the result in a text output box.
- Uses the OpenAI GPT-3 or GPT-4 model (via the `openai` Python package).
- Environment variables for securely handling the OpenAI API key.

- Python 3.x (Python 3.6 or later recommended)
- OpenAI API key (sign up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) to get an API key)
